What is WeightedSelector.NET? 
==============

WeightedSelector.NET lets you assign weights to a set of choices, then make  decisions based on each choice's proportion of the total weight. 

This is useful for scenarios where choices need to be made based on complicated but quantifiable factors. Great examples include suggestion engines and game AI.

WeightedSelector.NET has a very simple API that makes it fun to use. In one of the examples, we implement a game AI that decides between attacking, fleeing, and casting a heal spell based on a dynamic "fear" factor... In 9 lines of code!
